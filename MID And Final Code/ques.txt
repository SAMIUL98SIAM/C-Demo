Instructions
You have to manage a contact list where you keep the list the phone numbers, names, address of your friends and families or business relations.
Create a console based C# application to make the management of this list easier for you.
This application will have two parts - one to deal with data entry, data update and data deletion and the other part is for searching contact based on names.
The data needed to be saved for each conacts are as follows - name, address, phone number and relataion type (FRIEND, FAMILY, BUSINESS).
The program structure will have to follow the way we learnt in lab class.
The application will have one entry class to start the program with Main, one IO class that will handle Input/Output, one class that will manage all the contacts (will contain the list of all contacts), once class to keep contact data (phone, name, etc).
The io class will sit in a loop and ask what the user wants to do - add, update, delete or search by name.
The program will work accordig to user's intention.
